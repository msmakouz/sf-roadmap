# Testing

Testing is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring that your application behaves as expected and helps to prevent regressions when changes are made. The Spiral Framework provides a robust testing environment, making it easy to write and run tests for your application.

Spiral uses PHPUnit as its primary testing framework. It provides a FakeHttp class for making requests to your application and inspecting the responses, making it straightforward to test your HTTP controllers. It also offers functionality for testing file uploads, working with session data, and testing user authentication.

The testing environment in Spiral is flexible and powerful, designed to make it as easy as possible to ensure your application is working correctly.
