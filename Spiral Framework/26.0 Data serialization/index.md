# Data Serialization

Data serialization is a process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be stored or transported. Spiral Framework provides a component for serializing and deserializing data. The component provides only the simplest serializers out of the box and may not cover all your use cases. But it provides an easy way to integrate serialization tools into the Spiral Framework or develop your solutions for serializing data in your application.
