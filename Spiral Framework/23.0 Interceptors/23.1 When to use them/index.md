# When to use them

Interceptors are a convenient way to intercept and modify the behavior of certain parts of the application, making it more functional and efficient, while keeping the domain-specific logic clean and maintainable. Here are some benefits of using interceptors:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Using interceptors allows you to keep the different parts of your application separate and organized. For example, you can use an interceptor to handle authentication without having to add that code to every single part of your application that requires authentication. This makes it a lot easier to understand and maintain your code.
- **Reusability**: With interceptors, you can write code once and use it in multiple parts of your application. This means you don't have to keep writing the same code over and over again, saving you time and reducing the likelihood of mistakes.
- **Modularity**: The ability to add, remove or replace interceptors without affecting the rest of the application makes it more flexible and easy to update.
- **Performance**: Interceptors can be used to optimize the performance of the application by caching responses, reducing the number of database queries, and more. This means your application will be faster, and less likely to slow down when a lot of users are accessing it at the same time.

Specific use cases:
- **Logging**: Interceptors can be used to log information about the application's operation. For example, you could create an interceptor that logs every database query that is executed, along with information about how long the query took to run. This can be useful for performance tuning and debugging.
- **Caching**: If your application retrieves data from a slow source (like a remote API or a large database), you could use an interceptor to cache the results of these operations. The interceptor would first check if the data is in the cache, and if so, return the cached data instead of performing the slow operation.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Interceptors can be used to check if a user is authenticated and authorized to perform a certain operation. For example, before a user is allowed to update a record in the database, an interceptor could check if the user has the necessary permissions.
- **Input Validation**: You could use an interceptor to validate the inputs to a method or function. If the inputs are not valid, the interceptor could throw an exception or return an error, preventing the operation from being performed.
- **Rate Limiting**: If you want to limit how often a certain operation can be performed (for example, to prevent abuse or to control resource usage), you could use an interceptor to keep track of how often the operation is performed and throw an exception or return an error if the limit is exceeded.
- **Transaction Management**: In a database application, you could use an interceptor to manage database transactions. The interceptor could start a transaction before the operation is performed and commit the transaction after the operation is successful. If an error occurs during the operation, the interceptor could roll back the transaction.
