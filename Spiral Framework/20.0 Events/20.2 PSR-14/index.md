### PSR-14

PSR-14 is a PHP standard that defines interfaces for dispatching events. It allows libraries and components to be reused more freely between various applications and frameworks. Spiral Framework's event system is compatible with PSR-14, which means you can use any PSR-14 compatible event dispatcher with Spiral Framework.
