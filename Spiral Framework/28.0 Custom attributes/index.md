# Custom attributes

Attributes in PHP are a way to add metadata to classes, properties, functions, constants, and parameters. This metadata can be used to modify the behavior of the code at runtime. Spiral Framework supports the use of custom attributes to add additional functionality or modify the behavior of your application.

Attributes can be used in various parts of your application, such as controllers, services, and models. They can be used to define routing information, validation rules, and more. This allows you to keep your code clean and focused on its primary responsibilities, while the attributes handle the ancillary concerns.
