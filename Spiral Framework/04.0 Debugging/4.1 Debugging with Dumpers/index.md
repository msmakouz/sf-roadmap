# Debugging with Dumpers

Debugging is a crucial part of the development process. In Spiral Framework, you can use dumpers to inspect variables and objects during the execution of your code. This can be very useful for understanding the state of your application at any given point.

Spiral Framework provides its own built-in dumper. However, you can also use Symfony's VarDumper component, which provides several functions to dump variables in a more human-readable format.

Remember, the output of these dumpers will be sent to the output (browser, console, etc.) directly.
