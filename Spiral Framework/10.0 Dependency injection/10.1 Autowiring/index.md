10.1 Autowiring

## Autowiring

Autowiring is a feature of the Spiral container that allows automatic resolution of class dependencies. This means that the container can automatically create and inject dependencies for a class without the need for explicit configuration.

The container supports advanced features like union types, variadic arguments, referenced parameters and default object values for the auto-wiring.
