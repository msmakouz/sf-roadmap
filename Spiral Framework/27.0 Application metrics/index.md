## Application Metrics

Application metrics are crucial for keeping track of the performance and health of your application. Spiral Framework, in conjunction with the RoadRunner plugin, provides the ability to send application metrics to Prometheus, an open-source monitoring system. This allows you to collect, store, and analyze time series data such as application metrics. You can then use a tool like Grafana to visualize these metrics in real-time.
