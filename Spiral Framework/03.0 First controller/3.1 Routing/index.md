# Routing

Routing module allows to set under what URL the resource will be available. In Spiral Framework you can do that using attributes.

>#[Route(route: '/', name: 'index', methods: 'GET')] 

You can set HTTP method that will lead to given controller method and you can set additional parameters like id of the resource you want to process.
